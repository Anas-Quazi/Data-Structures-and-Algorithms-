# 📌 About This Repository

This repository contains my C++ implementations of core Data Structures and Algorithms that I am currently studying.

I follow a learning-by-doing approach, where I code concepts alongside studying them. The repository is structured topic-wise, with separate files and folders for each data structure and algorithm.<br><br>


## 🔹 It includes:

- Basic concepts and implementations of data structures  
- Common operations and helper functions  
- Solutions to selected LeetCode problems (with problem numbers for reference)<br><br>
